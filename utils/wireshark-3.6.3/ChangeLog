    http: Pass data relative to the original offset to follow tap

    dissect_http_message might get called with a nonzero offset into
    the tvb if there are multiple messages/segments in a frame. Only
    send data starting from that offset to the follow tap, instead of
    starting at tvb offset 0. Fix #18006

    packaging: Add RPM build dependencies for ninja, asciidoctor

    If we're building with ninja, we need to require it.

    While CentOS/RHEL/Rocky 8 doesn't have a asciidoctor package
    (so we install it separately), we can add a BuildRequires on
    the file that RubyGems creates for other rpm based distributions.

Date:   Mon Mar 14 12:11:24 2022 -0700

    wiretap: add a dump-close API that provides a "needs to be reloaded" indication.

    This allows the "needs to be reloaded" indication to be set in the close
    process, as is the case for ERF; having a routine that returns the value
    of that indication is not useful if it gets seet in the close process,
    as the handle for the wtap_dumper is no longer valid after
    wtap_dump_close() finishes.

    Fixes #17989.

    column-utils: Add missing check for frame_data::has_ts

    Adds check for frame_data::has_ts in col_set_delta_time before calling
    set_time_seconds. This is the same check that is done in multiple other
    methods in column-utils.c. Because frame_data::tsprec might not be
    initialized if has_ts is false, this resulted in a failed assertion in
    set_time_seconds if the user created a column with "Delta time".

    Also adds an assertion for frame_data::has_ts in set_time_seconds.

    NTLMSSP: fix dissecting the spnego mechListMIC payload

    dissect_ntlmssp() is also called from dissect_spnego_T_mechListMIC(),
    we should detect a 16 byte structure starting with 0x01
    and use dissect_ntlmssp_verf().

    All other messages in dissect_ntlmssp() start with the
    magic string "NTLMSSP", so they never match the 0x01.

    It fixes another problem seen in the example captures

    NTLMSSP: fix AUTHENTICATE_MESSAGE without NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE_VERSION

    If we have data remaining before the start of the variable data,
    we should assume the space for the version field even without

    mark the 8 bytes as zero bytes.
